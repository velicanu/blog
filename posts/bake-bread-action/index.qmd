### Steps

**Step 1** – Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl. No need to knead, but mix them enough so that everything is wet. It shouldn’t take too long and will look something like this:

Initial state, all ingredients mixed.

**Step 2** – Cover bowl with the mixed ingredients and let it sit at room temperature for two hours. The mixture will rise and at the end it will look something like this:

**Step 3** – After the dough has sat for two hours, pull and fold it onto itself a few times, then cover it and put it into the fridge for a day.

**Step 4** – After the dough has sat in the fridge for a day it will look something like the picture below. Again pull and fold it onto itself a few times, cover it and place it back into the fridge for another day.

**Step 5** – Now the dough has fermented in the fridge for a total of two days, it will look like the picture below and smell like beer. It is now ready to bake.

**Step 6** – Take the dough out of the bowl, fold it one last time onto itself and place it on a parchment paper. Place the parchment paper in a big round bowl for the bread to rise outside one last time for about 2 hours.

**Step 7** – When the dough is starting to look poofy turn on the oven to 450F with the dutch oven inside, let it preheat for at least 30 minutes. When the oven and dutch oven are both hot, place the parchment paper with the dough in the dutch oven and cover it. Bake it covered for 40 minutes, then bake it uncovered for 20 more minutes. Bonus points if make a small cut diagonally.
Put the dough in the hot dutch oven and bake.

**Step 8** – Take the dough out of the oven, it should feel hard and have a nice brown crust. Place it on a cooling rack for at least 30 minutes to let it cool and finish the cooking process.
